# photo-album
It's a fun project did for practice. A combo of go + rest api + swagger + docker + kafka. Don't take this as a model . It's just a practice.  Work is in progress. Feel free to correct me. 

# To try this project
git clone https://github.com/asish-tom/photo-album.git
docker-compose -f photo_album/docker-compose.yml up -d --build kafka web zookeeper
